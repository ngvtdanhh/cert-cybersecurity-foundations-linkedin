# 🧱 Defense in Depth – Layered Security Model

Defense in Depth is a multi-layered approach to security. Each layer acts as a barrier to protect assets even if one fails.

## 🧩 Layers of Security

1. **Physical Security** – Locks, cameras, restricted access
2. **Network Security** – Firewalls, IDS/IPS, segmentation
3. **Endpoint Security** – Antivirus, patching, disk encryption
4. **Application Security** – Secure coding, WAFs
5. **User Awareness** – Security training, phishing tests
6. **Administrative Controls** – Policies, audits, incident response plans

## 🔐 Why It Matters

- No single control is perfect
- Layers reduce attack surface
- Increases attacker effort and detection chance
