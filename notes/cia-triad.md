# 🔐 The CIA Triad – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

The **CIA Triad** forms the foundation of all information security models. Each component represents a critical aspect of data protection:

## 🔒 Confidentiality
- Ensures information is **only accessible** to authorized users.
- Prevents data leakage, eavesdropping, and unauthorized viewing.
- Techniques:
  - Encryption (AES, RSA)
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs)
  - MFA and strong passwords

## 🧬 Integrity
- Maintains data **accuracy and consistency** over its lifecycle.
- Protects against unauthorized changes (intentional or accidental).
- Techniques:
  - Hashing (SHA-256)
  - Digital signatures
  - File integrity monitoring (FIM)

## 🕒 Availability
- Ensures systems and data are **accessible when needed**.
- Protects against downtime, DDoS attacks, and hardware failures.
- Techniques:
  - Backups and redundancy
  - Load balancing
  - UPS and failover mechanisms

> A breach in any of these principles compromises system security.
