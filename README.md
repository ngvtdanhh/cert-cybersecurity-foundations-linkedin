## 📝 Course Review

The **Cybersecurity Foundations** course by LinkedIn Learning is a strong introductory course that balances theory with real-world relevance.

✅ **Highlights:**
- Clear explanation of cybersecurity principles
- Good coverage of common threats and defenses
- Suitable for aspiring SOC analysts, GRC, or Red Team interns

📌 **Suggestions:**
- Would benefit from more hands-on labs or capture-the-flag (CTF)-style tasks
- Could include more technical breakdowns (e.g., logs, firewall config, etc.)
